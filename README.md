# Inspiration
As people who enjoy art, we often find ourselves in situations where we are too busy to have time to seek and enjoy art. In the same vein, local performers often find themselves with a lack of recognition by local communities.

Our project aims to solve these issues by facilitating connections between performers and art enthusiasts - capturing the feeling of suddenly immersing yourself into the performance of a street busker. We want to embody the spontaneity of seeing and stopping for a fascinating busking performance.

# What does it do?
We created an app which allows street buskers to share their performance's location. People can find such performances in their vicinity, live. These performances can be geomarked, and tagged with a specific genre/type which the audience can filter.

For audiences and busy city dwellers, it provides opportunities to casually experience art while minimizing commitment and opportunity cost. For local artists struggling with growing their audience and gaining visibility, our app increases turnout for their live performances and increases exposure to locals interested in their art forms and genres.

Note that this works for a broad set of buskers. Such as caricature services, passionate guitarists, live drawing, etc.
